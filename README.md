Instructions on replacing the original cable chain on the Formbot T-Rex 3 

## Removing the original cable chain 

1. Remove the four screws holding the cover on the power distribution board. 
2. Unscrew the two terminals holding in the thermistor wire (two red wires with a white protective wrapper)
3. Carefully un-route the thermistor wire so it is free
4. Remove the protective cap from the relay
5. Unscrew the two white cables from the left side of the relay (AC power)
6. Unscrew the M3 screw and T nut mounting the cable to the frame
7. Remove the zip tie securing the AC bed wire together
8. Pull gently on the AC cable near the bed side of the cable chain to access the M3 screw holding the cable chain to the bed. 
9. Remove the cable chain from the bed
10. Tuck the AC wires where the relay was neatly into the opening in the protective shield. Wrap in one layer of removable tape. 
11. Pull the AC wire through the cable chain until you reach the plug

## Dismantling the Plug

12. Unscrew the top cover of the plug
13. Remove the cable anchor
14. Unscrew both sides of the AC adapter. Mark the left hand side with a black marker. 
15. Pull the old cable chain through the remaining AC cable and thermistor wire, removing it. Feed the new cable chain on the same way the old one came off. 
16. Reassemble the plug. 

## Finishing 

17. Feed the thermistor wire through the cable chain.
18. Reattach the cable chain to the bed the same way it came off. Use the first hole in the cable chain mount.
19. Use the T-Nut and screw that came with the new cable chain to secure it in the same place the old one came off. Again, use the first hole in the cable chain end. 
20. Reattach the white AC wires. 
21. Ensure that there is enough slack in the wires at the bed side of the cable chain that it has some room to bend with the movement of the bed.
22. Resecure the wires in the same locations using the zip ties. Reattach the thermistor wires and put the cover back on the power distribution board.
